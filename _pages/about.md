<h2 id="biography"> About Ian</h2>  
I am a tenure-track assistant professor at [Miner School of CIS at UMASS Lowell](https://www.uml.edu/sciences/computer-science/). I work on machine learning, security, and privacy. Before joining UMASS Lowell, I was a postdoc at [CNSR@VT](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/) and obtained my Ph.D. at [CNSG@ASU](http://cnsg.asu.edu). I received my B.S. from PKU and M.Phil from CUHK, Hong Kong.

* We have ongoing Colloquium at CS@UMass Lowell. Check out the exciting talks [here](https://ianchen88.github.io/cscolloquium/)!

* Our paper **Adversarial Attacks on Federated Learning Revisited: a Client-Selection Perspective** is accepted by IEEE CNS 2024. We are the first to identify the new attack vector on Federated Learning, i.e., client selection step, and demonstrate the attack consequences. Congrutulation to Xingyu and other authors. (Aug. 2024)
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for IEEE CNS 2024, WPES 2024 (Co-located with ACM CCS 2024), IEEE MILCOM 2024, PETs 2025, and IEEE INFOCOM 2025. (May 2024)
* Our paper **Securing Contrastive mmWave-based Human Activity Recognition against Adversarial Label Flipping** is accepted by ACM WiSec 2024 as a full paper. We explored the impacts of data poisoning attacks on supervised contrastive learning and existing selection schemes as the defense. Congrutulation to Amit and other authors. (Apr. 2024)
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2024 PETs, IEEE INFOCOM and MILCOM. (Apr. 2023)
* Our paper **mmLock: User Leaving Detection against Data Theft via High-Quality mmWave Radar Imaging** is accepted by IEEE ICCCN 2023 as an invited paper. We used PointNet and Bi-LSTM to model user leaving behavior from mmWave radar signals. Congrutulation to Jiawei and other authors. (Apr. 2023)
* Our paper **DUO: Stealthy Adversarial Example Attack on Video Retrieval Systems via Frame-Pixel Search** is accepted by IEEE ICDCS 2023 (Acceptance ratio: 83/439=18.9%). We proposed a novel adversarial example attack on video retrieval models with sparse perturbations only. Congrutulation to Xin and other authors. (Apr. 2023)
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2023 IEEE CNS and ICCCN. (Mar. 2023)
* Our paper **Squeezing More Utility via Adaptive Clipping on Deferentially Private Gradients in Federated Meta-Learning** is accepted by ACSAC 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 73/303=24.0%). The idea is to adapt differential privacy to address data privacy challenges in Federated Meta-Learning. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Sep. 2022)
* Our paper **Clang __usercall: Towards Native Support for User Defined Calling Conventions** is accepted by ACM ESEC/FSE 2022 Demo track. The idea is to mimic popular syntax and adapting Clang for interfacing purpose of C/C++ code. Congrutulation to Jared and other authors. (Aug. 2022)
* Our paper **Transferability of Adversarial Examples in Machine Learning-based Malware Detection** is accepted by IEEE CNS 2022. The idea is to spread out adversarial perturbations in order to improve transferability of adversary example attacks. Congrutulation to Yang and other authors. (Aug. 2022)
* Ian is to serve as a TPC member for 2022 IEEE INFOCOM, CNS, and MASS. (Apr. 2022)
#* Our paper **FLARE: Defending Federated Learning against Model Poisoning Attacks via Latent Space Representations** is accepted by ACM ASIACCS 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 18.4%). The idea is to detect model poisoning attacks on federated learning by exploring the penultimate layer representations of neural network. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Feb. 2022)
#* Our paper **MANDA: On Adversarial Example Detection for Network Intrusion Detection System** is accepted by IEEE TDSC. The idea is to detect adversarial example attacks by exploring the data space. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Feb. 2022)
#* Our paper **FeCo: Boosting Intrusion Detection Capability in IoT Networks via Contrastive Learning** has been accepted by IEEE INFOCOM 2022 (Acceptance ratio: 225/1129=19.9%). The idea is to use contrastive learning to learn the representation of benign traffic. Congrutulation to Ning and other authors. (Dec. 2021)
#* Ian joined CS@UMASS Lowell as an incoming TTAP. (Sep. 2021) -->
