<h2 id="biography"> Biography</h2>  

<small> I am now a postdoctoral associate in Department of Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am actively searching for academic positions My supervisor is [Dr. Wenjing Lou](https://www.cnsr.ictas.vt.edu/WJLou.html). I obtained my Ph.D. degree from Arizona State University, Tempe in 2018, advised by [Dr. Yanchao Zhang](http://cnsg.asu.edu/zhang/). Before that, I received my B.S. from School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science at Peking University in 2010 and M.Phil. from Department of Electrical Engineering at Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2013. My primary research interests are security and privacy in machine/meta learning and networked systems. </small>
